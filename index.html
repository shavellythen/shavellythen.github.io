    <h1>Hello! I'm Shavelly Then</h1>

    <p>I am passionate about <strong>UI/UX design and Web Design</strong>. I am a skilled front-end developer and master many graphic design tools such as Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. I am a quick learner and a team worker that gets the job done. My design practice combines design thinking, user research and experience strategy, all with a relentless focus on the user.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m currently working at the University of Miami as the Web Manager for Development and Alumni Relations.</p>

    <p>A little bit about me...I am often times confused with an extrovert because I am friendly, outspoken and a leader. However, I conside my self an introvert because social outing drain my energy. I searched google to find the answer for this puzzle and it says that there is a hybrid personality trait. An ambivert is someone who exhibits qualities of both introversion and extroversion, and can flip into either depending on their mood, context, and goals.</p>

    <p>Ambiverts have also been called:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Outgoing introverts: An introvert who can be outgoing in certain situations, around certain people, or when they absolutely need to.</li>
      <li>Antisocial extroverts: An extrovert who needs time to recharge before socializing, or who likes to be alone more than a typical extrovert.</li>
      <li>Social introverts: An introvert who can dial up into extroversion when needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I think that I am an antisocial extrovert. I don't like to turn on my camera on any zoom meeting, I don't like to go out a lot or be around people for a long period of time. However, I know how to be social and I am not a shy person. I find this very interesting.</p>

    <h2>Early life and Education</h2>

    <p>I was born and raised in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The Dominican Republic is a Caribbean nation that shares the island of Hispaniola with Haiti to the west. My husband and I went to Christ for the Nations Institute in Dallas, Texas on 2015 to learn how to be Youth Pastors. Youth pastors work for churches where they lead children and teenagers, educate them about Christianity, and encourage them to worship, do volunteer work, and get involved in community outreach. After we finished school, we stayed in Dallas so that I could get my bachelors degree from Dallas Baptist University.</p>

    <p>I was able to graduate Magna cum laude and I am now getting my masters degree at the University of Miami.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>

    <p>My first born, Claudio Andres was born on September 27, 2007. Claudio is turning 14 soon and he is almost my same height (5"5). Claudio loves sports and gaming. I had Claudio when I was 18 so he is my pride and joy.</p>
