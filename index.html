               <p>
                  I’m focused on creating
                  meaningful experiences
                  through design and I am passionate about UI/UX design and Web Design.

                  I am a skilled front-end developer and master many graphic design tools such as Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. I am a quick learner and a team worker that gets the job done. My design practice combines design thinking, user research and experience strategy, all with a relentless focus on the user. I’m currently working at the University of Miami as the Web Manager for Development and Alumni Relations. I have experience working with teams
                  to brainstorm and whiteboard concepts.
                  I can create wireframes at varying
                  levels of fidelity, and enjoy prototyping
                  ideas. I have some front-end coding
                  experience, and enjoy working with
                  devs to build ideas out.

                  I am often times confused with an extrovert because I am friendly, outspoken and a leader. However, I conside my self an introvert because social outing drain my energy. I searched google to find the answer for this puzzle and it says that there is a hybrid personality trait. An ambivert is someone who exhibits qualities of both introversion and extroversion, and can flip into either depending on their mood, context, and goals.

                  Eleifend auctor turpis magnis sed porta nisl pretium. Aenean suspendisse nulla eget sed etiam parturient
                  orci cursus nibh. Quisque eu nec neque felis laoreet diam morbi egestas. Dignissim cras rutrum consectetur
                  ut penatibus fermentum nibh erat malesuada varius.
               </p>
               <p>Ambiverts have also been called:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>Outgoing introverts: An introvert who can be outgoing in certain situations, around certain people, or when they absolutely need to.</li>
                  <li>Antisocial extroverts: An extrovert who needs time to recharge before socializing, or who likes to be alone more than a typical extrovert.</li>
                  <li>Social introverts: An introvert who can dial up into extroversion when needed.</li>
               </ul>
               <p>I think that I am an antisocial extrovert. I don't like to turn on my camera on any zoom meeting, I don't like to go out a lot or be around people for a long period of time. However, I know how to be social and I am not a shy person. I find this very interesting.</p>

               <p>
                  People who are introverted tend to be inward turning, or focused more on internal thoughts, feelings and moods rather than seeking out external stimulation. Introversion is not the same thing as social anxiety or shyness.

                  Extroverts are often described as the life of the party. Their outgoing, vibrant nature draws people to them, and they have a hard time turning away the attention. They thrive off the interaction.
